# Quantum-Symmetry-Factorization
QSF is based on group theory and modular arithmetic principles. The algorithm uses a symmetry-based approach, meaning it focuses on patterns and properties in the modular system that repeat. By focusing on values that align with these patterns, QSF can quickly eliminate non-factors and focus on high-probability candidates.
